 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
 When would you use one instead of another?

 Forks are copies of public projects. Forks are Github specific clones.  Branches
 are histories of work within a repository.  Use clone to bring a repo local and
 fork to keep it on github (from github).  Branches are for creating new lines
 of work within a repo.
