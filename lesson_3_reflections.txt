When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're sharing your work among a group

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 In case you want to review or make changes locally that you don't want to publish

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
 When would you use one instead of another?

 Forks are copies of public projects. Forks are Github specific clones.  Branches
 are histories of work within a repository.  Use clone to bring a repo local and
 fork to keep it on github (from github).  Branches are for creating new lines
 of work within a repo.

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

 You can see what the difference is between what you're working on and the starting
 point of what others may be working on.

 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
  and what would be harder?

  Much harder to work on items at the same time or to create different copies without
  changing file names.
